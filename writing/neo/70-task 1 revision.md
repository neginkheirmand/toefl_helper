## Revised Writing
Introduction:
The lecture challenges the theories presented in the passage about the purpose of the shafts in the Great Pyramid. The professor argues that these theories are problematic and offers counterarguments for each.

Body Paragraph 1:
The passage suggests that the shafts were intended for ventilation to assist workers by providing fresh air and reducing smoke. However, the lecturer argues against this theory, noting that two of the four shafts do not reach the surface and therefore could not have served as ventilation. Since all four shafts should logically have the same function, this inconsistency undermines the theory.

Body Paragraph 2:
The second theory posits that the shafts were aligned with specific stars to honor gods. The lecturer refutes this by pointing out that the pyramids were built before the religious associations with these stars became significant. Thus, the alignment of the shafts with these stars would not have had the intended religious meaning during that time.

Body Paragraph 3:
The passage also proposes that the shafts served as passageways for the king’s spirit to enter the afterlife. The lecturer dismisses this theory by highlighting that other contemporary pyramids used symbolic rather than physical passageways for this purpose. Therefore, the physical shafts were not necessary for the king’s spirit to travel to the afterlife.

Conclusion:
In summary, the lecturer provides valid counterarguments to each of the theories discussed in the passage, challenging their credibility and suggesting that the true purpose of the shafts remains uncertain.
