Question :Dr.Diaz
This week, we will be discussing retail sales. One popular model of retail is "superstores"-very large stores, typically owned by corporations- that sell many kinds of different products. We will compare this business model to local retailers, typically small or specialized stores with local owners, such as a camera shop or a small neighborhood grocery store. Do you think it is more beneficial for people to shop at small local stores rather than at superstores? Why or why not?

Shopping at small local stores benefits consumers in many ways. One of the benefits is that small stores often offer better services than large stores. For example, if you need your bicycle repaired, usually the small shop can do it right there in the shop. At the large stores, they have to send it to the manufacturer to be repaired.

Although I understand the importance of shopping at small stores to support the local community, there are obvious benefits to shopping at superstores. Because large retailers procure products in bulk, they can offer their customers a wide variety of products, usually at low prices. So, by shopping at large stores, consumers get better value for their money.

my writing:
Shopping at local stores brings a lot of benefits for the local bussinesses. Plus local bussineses have shown to produce more organic and sustainable packaging and produce which can save the environment and help you stay healthy on the long run. 
Plus you are not only helping the environment and the local community by shopping at local stores, since in small shops the producer is closer to the customer if a problem arises with the product you can get a repare a lot faster than compared to superstores. Plus staff at small bussineses are a lot more understanding than workers at a superstore where the policy of the company that runs the store is always saying the last word. Another benefit could be that the staff at your local market may be old friends of your school or old teammates from your local soccer team, and thus you will be leaving the store with a smile and a good talking topic about how you say your old classmate today. It boosts up moral on the day to day life of the community.
